1900	Théorie de la Spéculation 	Louis Bachelier	First financial theory based on advanced mathematics derived from natural processes (such as Brownian motion that was also adopted by Albert Einstein for his relativity theory 5 years later). Bachelier's approach was largely ignored and preceded the so-called Black-Scholes-Merton model (1973) by over 70 years, which triggered the multibillion-dollar industry of derivative option trading and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1997. 
1901	Radio Transmission	Guglielmo Marconi	First transatlantic radio transmission, demonstrating the possibility of wireless communication. Hopes of peace due to better communication did not materialize. Like all subsequent communication technologies, it transformed but could not prevent social conflicts.
1901	Wandervögel	Herman Hoffmann Fölkersamb	Created as a back-to-nature youth organization in Germany emphasizing freedom, self-responsibility, and the spirit of adventure. It was a reaction to the materialism, hypocrisy, and stifling social conservatism of the Wilhelminian Reich. Most Wandervögel ('birds of passage') came from well-to-do middle-class families. It's both one of the first youth movements and modern counter-cultures. 
1904	National Child Labor Committee (US)	Edgar Gardner Murphy	The foundation of this committee marks the beginning of the modern children's rights movement. According to the 1900 US Census, 1 of 6 children between 5 and 10 years old was engaged in wage labor. The immediate goal was to abolish child labor nationwide. This was achieved in 1938 when the "Fair Labor Standards Act" was signed into law in the context of the New Deal reforms.
1905	Russo-Japanese War		A twenty months long war over over rival imperial ambitions in Manchuria and Korea ends with the defeat of Russia. This was the first defeat of a European country against a non-European adversary in modern history and marked the end of the colonial expansion towards the East. It revealed the weakness of the Czarist regime and triggered the first Russian revolution.  
1905	The Special Theory of Relativity	Albert Einstein	Overturning the paradigm of Newtonian physics, which had been dominant for 200 years, relativity theory has changed basic conceptions of space and time. It established the notion of an upper speed limit equivalent to the speed of light and had numerous repercussions for atomic physics, nuclear physics, and quantum mechanics. It also had implications for the way in which we see the world reaching far beyond physics and natural sciences, establishing freedom, openness and indeterminacy as fundamental categories of human knoweldge. 
1909	First modern securitization 	Samuel W. Straus	The first time a financial instrument combined different assets (a mortgage bond with a senior tranche).  Securitization transforms illiquid asset(s) into a security. The principle behind Mortgage-Backed Securities in the 2008 subprime crisis: mortgages are combined into one large pool that's divided into smaller pieces based on each mortgage's risk of default and then sold to investors. The aim is to enable smaller investors to purchase shares in a larger asset pool, but risks are hard to monitor due to its complexity. 
1909	Manifesto of Futurism	Filippo Tommaso Marinetti	At the core of this manifesto is a positive reference to the new machine era. The subsequent Futurist movement enthusiastically embraced technology and the new sense of life that came with it: speed, noise and violence. Futurist manifestations in such diverse fields as painting, sculpture, theatre, music, literature and architecture invoked a society beyond Christian morality and rejected any celebration of the past as it takes place in museums, libraries and academies. 
1910	The Mundaneum	Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine	An institution based in Brussels to house all the knowledge of the world on 3x5" index cards. It flourished in the interwar period but declined after the German invasion of Belgium. Today, it is seens as an analog predecessor to the Internet. In 2012 Google announced a cooperation with the institution, today based in Mons, Belgium. 
1911	Taylorism	Frederick W. Taylor	In Principles of Scientific Management Taylor set out a method for rationalizing factory production by adapting the movement of the workers to the rhythms of the machine. Laid the groundwork for the assembly line production. Among his greatest admirers were Henry Ford and Vladimir Ilyich Lenin.
1913	A la recherche du temps perdu	Marcel Proust	The novel is named after the image of an interrupted wave inscribed on celluloid by Hermann von Helmholtz’ kymopgraph (“wave-scriber”) from 1848. The apparatus, directly attached to the nervous body of a frog, measures the time an impulse needs to travel through nerves. The lost time in-between impulse and reaction becomes visible as an interruption in a wave. Helmholtz notes under the image the words “temps perdu”. Inside and outside collapse, time enters the body, nerve and mind functions are from now on measured in the register of time. 
1913	The Assembly Line at Highland Park	Henry Ford	The assembly line production system at Ford Motor Company combined a number of earlier innovations in the American System of Manufacture to create a seamless production process along an assembly line. It significantly reduced cost per unit but also heightened the class antagonism and resulted in an unsustainably high turnover rate of workers. 
1914	Federal Reserve 		Foundation of U.S. Federal Reserve System, which is based on public/private ownership. The Federal Reserve Act was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson in 1913. Initialized the establishment of central banks as providers of credit, currency, money supply, and interest rates. Additionally of central banks act as lenders of last resort.
1914	First World War 		The first fully industrial war began, mobilizing all sectors of societies under military command, creating an unprecedented scale of destruction. It effectively ended the dominance of the British Empire and its ideology of free-trade, replacing them with an unstable system of nationalistic states that championed industrial and scientific innovation as a means of strengthening their competitive base. 
1915	Black Square	Kazimir Malevich	This painting of a black square, carried out in oil on linen, is considered a point zero of modern art, since it ended the paradigm of representation in visual art. Concurrent with similar tendencies in art in the Netherlands and Germany – as well as new scientific findings such as quantum physics – the painting marked a step to the construction of a new reality on an abstract plane, based on notions of universal and inalienable human values. 
1915	Fordism	Henry Ford	On January 5, 1915, Henry Ford announced the 5$ day, doubling the standard daily wage. The Ford system of production produced not only cars but also a new type of worker. Workers had to meet company standards for clean living, including sobriety, no gambling, thrift, and a happy home environment. In exchange, they were able to buy the products they built, expanding the consumer market.
1916	The Kuleshov Effect	Lev Kuleshov	The Soviet filmmaker’s early experiments with assembling fragments of pre-existing film are regarded to be the bedrock from which Soviet montage theory and techniques were derived. Kuleshov first coined the term ‘montage’ to explain the phenomena of shot succession specific to film and its power to create meanings and narratives thus providing the groundwork for all contemporary editing and documentary techniques.
1917	Animal magnetism	Nikolas Tesla	Tesla disappeared during award of the Edison Medal. He was found outside standing still, his arms spread like an electric tower, wearing a crown of pigeons on his head, shoulders and arms covered with a dozen more, hundreds more form a living aura around him. “Animal magnetism” was not simply a figure of speech for Tesla, but an everyday experience and personal responsibility that did not stop at the border between species. Tesla is the patron saint of a cybernetic triangle, linking human, animal, and machine.
1917	Fountain	Marcel Duchamp	This urinal turned upside down is submitted to, and initially rejected by the exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists, New York. As a "ready made" it reflected the paradigmatic shift from artisanal towards industrial production of everyday goods from the perspective of the artist, and became one of the most influential artworks of the 20st century. 
1917	October Revolution	Vladimir Ilyich Lenin	The October Revolution enabled the creation of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics (USSR) which formed a political counter-weight to the market-oriented West for 70 years. This had significant repercussions not only in Western politics but also in scientific and technological research and development strategies.
1918	First Drone	Charles Kettering	Unmanned “flying bomb” known as the Kettering Aerial Torpedo or the “Kettering Bug,” that was designed to hit a target at a range of 40 miles. It did not become functional during WWI,yet was part of the militarization of the air which became increasingly important.
1918	Universal Suffrage 		Women achieved the right to vote in many European countries in 1918-19.This ended a long 19th century struggle for “Equal and Common Suffrage” first for men, and later for women. The expansion of suffrage was a worldwide phenomenon throughout the following century. Restrictions based on race and ethnicity generally proved to be most resistant. The indigenous people of Australia had to wait till 1962 for their inclusion into the electorate, in the US most Black Americans till the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
1920	The Original Ponzi Scheme	Charles Ponzi	Charles Ponzi purchased postal coupons at a discount and sold them for full price, claiming the coupons would produce a 50% profit in 45 days. He paid investors from the proceeds of subsequent ones until the pyramid scheme finally blew up. "Ponzi scheme" has become the household word for fraudulent 'snow ball' schemes, among which the Enron scandal and the Bernie Madoff fraud case are the most infamous ones.
1920	To Make a Dadaist Poem 	Tristan Tzara	A revolution against the very concept of art, Dada introduced chance operations to undermine individual authorship and pre-existing material to undermine the notion of originality. This conceptual instruction how to make a Dada poem is a paradigmatic example of Dada. It introduces the ‘collage’ technique of producing ‘nonsense’ by randomly re-arranging pre-existing material and, as such, is constitutive of all subsequent mixing and sampling techniques that found their ideal medium with digital technology. 
1921	Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit    	Frank H. Knight	A crucial distinction is introduced here in modern economic thinking as well as financial market practice: between risk (where outcomes are unknown but governed by probability distributions) and uncertainty (were also the latter are unknown). He was one of the founders of the Mont Pelerin Society and the Chicago School of economics, the main voices of neoliberalism.
1922	Rise of fascism in Europe	Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler et al. 	In 1922, the Italian fascist Mussolini formed a government and in 1925 declared himself "duce" (leader). In 1933, Hitler was appointed German chancellor, the National Socialists took full power as the only legal political party later that year. Other European countries like Austria and Spain followed. Fascist regimes focused heavily on information technology and propaganda to consolidate power; developed early mass media such as radio to influence and control the population; and poured money into a technological military build-up for war. 
1922	Telephone Pictures	László Moholy-Nagy	The first use of telecommunications as an artistic medium by the Hungarian constructivist artist Moholy-Nagy. This work questioned the idea of the isolated individual artist and the unique art object.
1923	Enigma Encryption Machine	Arthur Scherbius, Alan Turing	This machine could encipher and decipher secret coded messages. One of its follower models was used by Nazi Germany in the Second World War. A team of mathematicians including Alan Turing together with female operators and an early, analog computer managed to break the Enigma code. This turned the submarine war in favor of the Allied forces and has been credited with shortening the war by two years.
1925	Elements of Physical Biology 	Alfred James Lotka	The first book ever about the mathematics of biological processes. Lotka introduced the mathematical and physical style to biology and opened up the field of physical biology. In particular the introduction of thermodynamic thinking related to the energy conversion of organisms establishes a pre-understanding of the role of information in biological processes; influencing the open system theory. It can also be seen as a first step into wetware computer logic describing biological cycles mathematically.
1925	ISOTYPE	Otto Neurath, Gerd Arntz and Marie Reidemeister	The International System of Typographic Picture Education ISOTYPE was developed starting in 1925 by Neurath, Arntz and Reidemeister at the Viennese Museum of Society and Economy. The goal was to use a visual method for popular education about complex political, social and economic issues. Isotype is still in use today and has experienced a renaissance in data journalism and information graphics.
1927	The Hawthorne Effect	Elton Mayo	A group of researchers from Harvard Business School conducted a series of studies into labour relations and workplace arrangements concluding that workers did better work when they received more attention as human beings - the Hawthorne Effect. After WWII those findings became the trigger of the human relations movement. Although originally conceived in industrial surroundings, the new methods were mostly applied to white collar workers.
1928	Soviet central planning: First Five Year Plan		Stalin introduced the first Five Year Plan for a rapid industrialization of Soviet Economy. It caused millions of deaths, especially through forced collectivization in agriculture, but also enabled the Soviets to withstand the assault of Hitler's high-tech army. The planned economy was for many years seen as a successful model, especially by poorer countries, for catching up with industrialization; forced the West into a systemic competition which eventually led to the creation of information society.   
1929	"Black Tuesday" stock market crash		On October 24, a stock market crash ended the post-World War I economic boom. The "Roaring Twenties" had been a time of prosperity and progress prompted by Fordism and stock market gambling. Over $30 billion were lost in two days. This shock heralded the start of the Great Depression, which affected most industrialized countries in the following decades. While financial regulation was strengthened in its wake, many controls have been rescinded again since the 1980s.
1929	Man with a Movie Camera	Dziga Vertov,  Elizaveta Svilova	An experimental silent documentary film, with no story and no actors. It is famous for the range of cinematic techniques Vertov invented, deployed or developed. It signalled the end of linear techniques of narration that dominated the Western culture of the Gutenberg Galaxy.
1929	Process and Reality	Alfred North Whitehead	Whitehead introduced a speculative philosophy that he called philosophy of organism: "... diverge from Descartes by holding that what he has described as primary attributes of physical bodies, are really the forms of internal relationships between actual occasions."
1930	A Treatise on Money 	John Maynard Keynes	In the Treatise Keynes drew a distinction between savings and investment, arguing that where saving exceeded investment, recession would occur. Thus, Keynes reasoned that during a depression the best course of action would be to promote spending and to discourage saving. Keynes ideas signalled a new form for the state to influence economies and were dominant until the 1970s. 
1930	Der Rundfunk als Kommunikationsapparat	Berthold Brecht	Part of Brecht's theoretical enquiry into radio as a device of mass media communication. He demanded that each receiver should also be a transmitter. It was an important theoretical reference for media activists in the 1970s and the 1990s.
1930	Salt March: Salt Laws Break	Mahatma Gandhi	The 24-day Salt March was a direct action campaign of tax resistance and nonviolent protest against the British salt monopoly. During the march, thousands of Indians followed Gandhi from his religious retreat near Ahmedabad to the Arabian Sea coast (240 miles).The march resulted in the arrest of nearly 60,000 people, including Gandhi himself. But the monopoly was revoked within a month. The march realized pieceful civil disobedience on a yet-not-imaginable scale and set an example for civil protest ever since. 
1931	Sociography (Marienthal Study)	Paul F. Lazarsfeld, Marie Jahoda et al.	This study into the patterns of unemployed people helped to establish the method of sociography in the social sciences. By meticulously investigating behavioral patterns of long-term unemployed in everyday life, the initiators hoped to establish new ways of social reform. Foundational for a range of disciplines which converged into social network analysis since the 1980s and is now used in heavily quantified form by social media platforms for the purpose of profit seeking. 
1933	Glass-Steagall Banking Act	Congressional sponsors: Senator Carter Glass (D) of Virginia, and Representative Henry B. Steagall (D) of Alabama.	In the wake of the 1929 market crash, the law's provisions separated the activities of commercial banking (deposits and loans) and investment banking (securities such as stocks and bonds) in order to separate risks and introduce a healthier financial system. The law was repealed in 1999 during the Clinton administration.
1933	Hollerith Machine  	IBM Germany	This machine provided indispensable technologic assistance for the industrialized destruction of human life by Nazi Germany. More than 2,000 such multi-machine sets were dispatched throughout Germany, and thousands more throughout German-dominated Europe. Card sorting operations were established in every major concentration camp. People were moved from place to place, systematically worked to death, and their remains catalogued with icy automation. 
1933	La Radia Manifesto	Felipe Tommasi Marinetti, Pino Masata	This futurist manifesto pointed towards the future of electronic communication, inviting disembodiment, interference and the emergence of a new form of audience.
1933	New Deal	 Franklin D. Roosevelt	Series of programs enacted by presidential executive order as well as laws passed by Congress in response to the Great Depression, the most profound economic crisis of the 20th century. Replaced laissez-faire economics. State orchestrated regulation and intervention generated an economic upturn with full employment achieved in 1941. Provided the post-World War II framework of Keynesian Fordism.
1933	Orloge Parlante (Speaking Clock)	Ernest Esclangon, Directeur de l’Observatoire de Paris	The first automated speaking clock was introduced in France. When you call the speaking clock, a voice tells you what time it is down to the exactitude of a tenth of a second, announcing: "At the third stroke, the time will be (hour) (minute) and (second) seconds," followed by three pips. It was one of the first machines to interact with remotely.
1935	Welfare State		Enacted as part of the New Deal, the US-American Social Security Act is the foundation of what would become the welfare state of the post-WW II era. Sweden introduced a similar, though more extensive regulation in 1936, creating the Scandinavian model of the welfare state. 
1936	Summer Olympics Berlin	German Post Office	First televised international sports event, utilized as a propaganda vehicle by the Nazi regime. They installed a closed-circuit television system and radio network that reached 41 countries, with many other forms of expensive high-tech electronic equipment.
1936	The Gallup Poll	George Gallup	The Roosevelt administration had a heightened interest in public opinion after the introduction of the New Deal. The new method developed by George Gallup to statistically gather the opinion of a representative sample of society was the only one to correctly predict the re-election of President Roosevelt in 1936.
1936	The Turing Machine 	Alan Turing	The Turing machine is a hypothetical device that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. The Turing machine was not intended as practical computing technology, but contained the idea of the computer in abstract form.
1936	The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction (or Reproducibility)	Walter Benjamin	This essay discussed the shifts of perception of the work of art in relation to technologies of reproduction and mass media dissemination, such as photography and film. 
1938	Colloque Walter Lippmann – inception of neoliberalism.  	Louis Rougier 	This conference in Paris was the birthdate of both the concept and the term “neoliberalism” (proposed by the German economist Alexander Rüstow) as a categorical rejection of collective socialism, fascism, and classic laissez-faire liberalism. It inspired Friedrich Hayek’s first Mont Pelerin meeting after WW II.
1938	Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)	Albert Hoffmann, Sandoz	The drug, advocated by intellectuals such as Aldous Huxley and Timothy Leary, produced altered states of consciousness which made people wanting to drop out of Fordist disciplinary society; contributed to "Summer of Love". Slogan: "tune in, turn on, drop out."
1938	The Programme Analyzer 	Paul Lazarsfeld, Frank Stanton	They invented a device for measuring audience satisfaction. Listeners could press a green or red button to express their (dis)satisfaction at a particular point. While invented for radio, it was soon applied for film and other media, contributing to quantitative sociological research into the perception of media by audiences.
1939	World War II		Following a short period of peace under the sign of the Great Depression, Germany started the most devastating violent conflict in human history to date. At the end of the war, a new world order had been established, effectively separating the world in U.S. and Soviet (hemi-)spheres of influence
1942	Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy	Joseph Schumpeter	Among other themes, the book deals with entrepreneurism, creative destruction (a term Schumpeter coined) and the demise of capitalism. It has become one of the most influential books on economy and social theory in general and especially for the New Economy of the "Silicon Valley".  
1942	Manhattan Project	J. Robert Oppenheimer et al.	Between 1942 and 1946 the first atomic bomb was developed by the USA with the help of the UK. This effort was based on a previously unprecedented integration of scientific research and military organisation, bringing together, besides Oppenheimer, mathematical geniuses such as John von Neumann and triggering the design of the US version of the world's first computer.
1942	Mertonian norms in science	Robert K. Merton 	This founding figure of the sociology of science codified the ethics of the scientific community expressed in the acronym CUDOS: c for communism, u for universalism, d for disinterestedness and o for organised skepticism. It expressed the idea that scientists act in the common, universal human interest rather than for particular groups and their purposes. 
1942	Z4 digital computer	Konrad Zuse	The Z4 was an electromechanical computer built between 1942 and 1945. In 1945 it was used at an aerodynamical research institute that worked for German Luftwaffe. Together with the Colossus, built in England, and the ENIAC, built in the USA, it was one of three "first" digital computing machines ever built. 
1943	A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity	Warren McCulloch, Walter Pitts	First attempt for a theory of the formal conditions for the description of cognition. Through mathematics and symbolic logic, the paper laid the foundations for the epochal integration of machines, organisms and minds, modelled as switchboards in the fashion of neural nets, which served John von Neumann as a model for the construction of the digital computer. This approach also fuelled a reductionist ideology of computational metaphors applied to the brain and life, and biological metaphors for automata and machine cognition. 
1944	A pioneering woman in computer science	Grace Murray Hopper	An American computer scientist and navy rear admiral, she was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer in 1944. She invented the first compiler for a computer programming language, and was one of those who popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages. She is credited with popularizing the term “debugging” for fixing computer glitches.
1944	Bretton Woods System established 		The postwar economic order was established in this agreement; made the U.S. dollar the de-facto world reserve currency by tying it to gold; the currencies of member states were flexibly pegged to the dollar. Other main components were the creation of the International Monetary Fund as lender of last resort and of the International Bank of Reconstruction (now World Bank); created the basis for the stability of the postwar economic order.
1944	Negative Entropy	Erwin Schrödinger	The Austrian physicist who developed quantum mechanics on the mystery of life and how it can be accounted by physics and chemistry. The book, What is life?, became famous for the introduction of the concept of negative entropy, i.e. the creation of order, characterizing living organisms. Organisms are open systems, he argued, evading the decay to thermodynamical equilibrium (entropy) by homeostatically maintaining their form of organisation. 
1944	The Great Transformation	Karl Polanyi	To Polanyi, the modern market economy and the modern nation state are a single human invention: the "market society". The creation of capitalist institutions not only changed laws but also altered humankind's economic mentalities – after the great transformation people became more economically rational while before they had based their economies on reciprocity and redistribution.
1945	Atomic Bomb	Robert Oppenheimer	First atomic bomb detonated by the United States. Bombs have been dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. For the first time, it became conceivable that mankind could destroy the entire planet Earth.
1945	The Memex 	Vannevar Bush	The paper "As We May Think" envisioned a universal networked library that anticipated the Internet. It should allow users to link together and view microfilm documents and thus represents one of the first concepts of Hypertext which now underpins the WWW. Bush's ideas inspired pioneers such as J.C.R. Licklider, Douglas Engelbart and Ted Nelson.
1945	The Use of Knowledge in Society	Friedrich Hayek	Hayek conceives the market doctrine of the neoliberal agenda. It is a precursor to the efficient market hypothesis: The market is defined as the only place where “all relevant information is concentrated” with the price system (a spontaneous order) coordinating the “utilization of knowledge not given to anyone in its totality." This vision replaced Keynesianism since the end of the 1970s.
1945	Von Neumann Architecture	John von Neumann	This paper described a method for a computer, which can, aside from other things, keep data and program instructions in memory. This made computers programmable and defined their architecture to this day.
1946	Focus Groups - Motivational Research 	Ernst Dichter	Although pioneered by Lazarsfeld, Dichter perfected the technique of focus group research into products and brands by merging it with Freudian depth-analysis into unconscious elements of the subject-product relation.
1946	Nuclear Overkill		The term refers to the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union. It was in common use during the Cold War era since both nations possess more than enough nuclear weapons to destroy one another many times over. Technological change was the foremost external dynamic to the evolution of the nuclear strategy in the early Cold War. 
1947	Iron Curtain - Start of the Cold War	Joseph Stalin, Harry S Truman, Winston Churchill 	The Iron Curtain, a metaphor coined by Winston Churchill in 1946, became a reality in 1947, after Joseph Stalin installed Communist governments controlled from Moscow in all countries liberated from Nazi occupation by the Red Army. This effectively separated the world into two large power blocs initiating the Cold War that lasted untill 1989.
1947	ISO (International Organization for Standardization)		The International Organization for Standardization was founded by 25 member countries to facilitate international trade. It was dedicated to continuing initial efforts from the interwar period to establish a trustworthy and authoritative body for the harmonization of industrial processes, units and terminology. As of today, its 162 member countries have agreed on close to 22,000 standards covering almost every imaginable domain.
1947	Mont Pelerin Society	Friedrich Hayek	Major think tank and network for the development of neoliberal economics and policies that convenes every year since 1947. It was instrumental in spreading neoliberalism. Eight of its members received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, George Stigler, James M. Buchanan, Maurice Allais, Gary Becker, Ronald Coase, Vernon Smith).
1947	Transistor	John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley	Invention of a semiconductor that amplifies signals at Bell Labs by Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockely (earlier research by Julius Lilienfeld, patent filed 1925) who were awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics "for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect." The transistor revolutionized the field of electronics.
1948	"Baby": The World's first stored-program Computer		"Baby" - official name Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM) - was the world's first stored-program computer. It was built in Manchester by a team that was later joined by Alan Turing who used its successor model to write generative software that simulated the development of skin patterns by animals (morphogenesis). 
1948	Cybernetics	Norbert Wiener	This book introduced the term cybernetics, from Greek "kybernetes" (steersman), referrring to the capacity of living systems and machines to sustain themselves through information used in feedback loops. Cybernetics together with systems theory established a new paradigm which sees people, animals, plants and machines as information processors reacting to changes in an open environment. Influencing various other sciences, it became foundational for the epistemology of the information society.
1948	Information Theory	Claude E. Shannon	The mathematical theory of communication, better known as information theory, created a mathematical model for the transmission of information. It also created a powerful scheme to thematize communication, the sender - channel - receiver scheme, which became influential far beyond information theory as such, affecting theories of cognition and even art and literature.
1949	Hedge Fund	Alfred W. Jones	The first investment fund that bought stock while selling other stock short – a risk management practice termed “hedge” (financial lingo for insuring against risk).
1949	Index Thomisticus	Roberto Busa	The Italian padre Roberto Busa successfully approaches Thomas J. Watson, Sr., head of IBM, in order to convince him to sponsor the machine supported creation of an index of all the works of Saint Thomas Aquinas. Initially based on punch-cards and later moved to magnetic tape based computers, Busa’s endeavor is completed after 30 years and approximately one million person hours. Although acknowledging his success to be rooted in higher powers, it is Busa who is considered to be a pioneer of "Digital Humanities".
1949	Le Deuxième Sexe	Simone de Beauvoir	Foundational work for the second wave of feminism. Established the anti-essentialist view that being a woman is not a matter of biology but of politics and culture.
1949	Nineteen Eighty-Four	George Orwell	George Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984, published in 1949, became one of the most influential literary critiques of totalitarian political systems and their use of technological means of mass surveillance, mass media control and propaganda.
1950	Credit Card	Ralph Schneider and Frank McNamara	Diners Club became the first general purpose credit card which established the model of consumer credit, short-term loans for goods and services for personal use.
1950	Kidney Transplant		First successful kidney transplant at Little Company of Mary Hospital, Illinois. The first recorded transplant of a liver was in 1933 in the Soviet Union, where the patient died two days later. Following were transplantations of livers (1963), lungs (1964) and hearts (1964).
1951	Biennale of São Paulo		The first international fine arts biennial outside of Europe. Kickstarts the globalization of modern and contemporary art.
1951	Toyotism / Kaizen	Ohno Taiichi	Car company Toyota implemented a range of methods for better integration of all members of the workforce in innovation processes (Kaizen), and for a closer integration of the workflow. Laid the foundations for Toyota overtaking US car producers in the 1980s; inaugurated new management philosophies of "lean production" and "just-in-time" systems.
1952	4′33″ (Silent Piece)	John Cage	The score of this composition instructs the performer(s) not to play their instrument(s) during the entire duration of the piece throughout the three movements. The piece has become a very influential piece of Avantgarde art due to its radical questioning of traditional musical reception, the standard distinction between sound and noise, and its focus on the borders between art and life.
1952	First biological simulation	Britton Chance	Britton Chance, a biochemist and a pioneer in the numerical simulations of metabolic pathways, for instance enzyme reactions, carried out the first biological simulations. Using an electric analogue computer he calculated a model of the catalyze process of an enzyme based on differential equations. In today’s computational design of wetware computer logic such models play a crucial role.
1952	Great Smog of London	 	Up to 12,000 people died in London within a few days in December 1952. Sulphur dioxide levels of 3,82 milligram per cubic meter led to widespread respiratory problems and tripled death rates for the elderly and small children. The event was a key starting point for the international environmental movement.
1952	M.U.C. Love Letter Generator	Christopher Strachey	The Love Letter Generator by Christopher Strachey is a prototypical work of combinatory electronic literature. It was based on Alan Turing's random number generator and generated combinatory love letters on the Manchester Mark I computer.
1953	Double Helix (structure of DNA)	James D. Watson, Francis Crick	The scientists established that the molecules of nucleic acids containing most of the hereditary information necessary for the reproduction of living entities had a double helical structure. It was a major breakthrough which opened the path to genetic research, genetic engineering, genetic profiling, bioinformatics and other current branches of bio- and life-sciences. 
1953	Pornotopia - Playboy Magazine	Hugh Hefner, Paul B. Preciado	Playboy magazine and its architectural expressions, the Playboy Townhouses, furniture and devices for male bachelors constituted Pornotopia, a utopian realisation of (male) desire, anticipating the Net as a spatial metaphor for sexual desires.
1953	Ulm College of Design (New Bauhaus)	Max Bill, Tomás Maldonado	The mission of the Ulm College of Design was to educate the German designers in a modernistic and cosmopolitan aesthetics as an antidote against the irrationalism and cultural backwardness that had dominated Nazi era Germany. The design college was pioneering science-based design methodologies, especially after Bill stepped down in 1958 and was replaced by a triumvirate of directors led by the Argentinian artist Tomás Maldonado.
1954	Information Aesthetics	Max Bense	The German philosopher tried to develop a scientifically founded theory of aesthetics. He combined Birkhoff's Aesthetic Measure, a simple formula for quantifying the beauty of vases, with Information Theory by Claude Shannon. Bense influenced early computer artists such as Frieder Nake and Georg Nees, Germany, Zdenek Sykora, Czechoslovakia, and Hiroshi Kawano, Japan. He also consulted Jasia Reichardt on the Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition.
1955	Montgomery Bus Boycott	Rosa Parks	Protest campaign against racial segregation on the public transport system. This event marked a major turning point in the civil rights struggle through the use of non-violent civil disobedience techniques.
1955	Two-step-Flow of Communication	Elihu Katz, Paul Lazarsfeld	Based on research conducted in the early 1940s, Katz and Lazarsfeld concluded that most people form an opinion based on opinion leaders among their primary group. Foundational for social media analysis.
1956	First Transatlantic Telephone Cable		The first transatlantic telecommunications cable (for other uses than telegraphy) was inaugurated on September 25, initially carrying 36 telephone channels.
1957	Atlas Shrugged	Ayn Rand 	Rand’s “philosophy” of rational selfishness, right of property, laissez-faire capitalism, contempt for state intervention and the poor is condensed in the words of a novel’s character: “a free mind and a free market are corollaries." Highly influential in US libertarian and entrepreneurial circles, followers (and partly lovers) include: Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the FED (“I was intellectually limited until I met her”); Paul Ryan, House of Representatives; Clarence Thomas, US-Supreme Court; Glenn Beck, talk show host; Peter Thiel, Silicon Valley entrepreneur. 
1957	Sputnik launched		The launch of the first, unmanned communication satellite by the Soviets created the "Sputnik shock" in the US, which was an impulse to invest more heavily in scientific research. One of the agencies founded in response was (D)ARPA ([defence] advanced research projects agency) which initiated and coordinated the research that lead to the Internet.
1957	The Way of Zen	Alan Watts	Popularizing Zen in the West, the book foreshadows the shift from materialist progress and self-interest towards new practices of self-awareness and against social alienation. Changing philosophical emphasis from being to becoming, incorporating Western thought (e.g. Norbert Wiener’s work on cybernetics), embracing social ethics based on humanity and nature, and endorsing experimenting with drugs, the book strongly influenced popular (counter)culture in the 60s and 70s.
1958	“The Computer and the Brain”	John von Neumann 	In his unfinished book von Neumann discusses brain-computer analogies based on theories of "cellular automata" and "neural networks." Although von Neumann concluded that such analogies were false, his research is seen as foundational for specific branches of Artificial Intelligence such as machine learning. 
1958	Bionics	Jack E. Steele	The application of biological methods and systems found in nature to the study and design of engineering systems and modern technology.
1958	Théorie de l'information et perception esthétique	Abraham A. Moles	The French sociologist, cybernetician and aestheticist developed an entirely different approach to Information Aesthetics than Bense. His aim was the integration of information theory, behavioral science, and structural aesthetics. It can be read as an early attempt to quantify perception and measure "originality" in an art work.
1958		Samuel Beckett	Theatre play with one actor sitting by a table with a tape recorder, a microphone, a number of reels of recorded tapes, and a ledger. ”A late evening in the future,” the 69 year old Krapp listens to recordings of himself as a 39 year old reporting that he has just reviewed an old tape from when he was in his late twenties where he was talking about himself in his late teens. Old man Krapp does also make a new recording commenting on the last year. The piece is important as an early articulation of the way in which human memory and consciousness is exteriorized in and mediated by technics and recording technologies.
1959	Alan Watts	Allan Kaprow	In his groundbreaking happening at the Reuben Gallery in New York, Kaprow synthesized his training in action painting with his study of Cage’s scored and performed events. Working from a carefully conceived and tightly scripted score, he created an interactive environment that invited the audience to participate to a degree virtually unprecedented in 20th century art. 
1960	Autodestructive Art Manifesto	Gustav Metzger	This manifesto envisions technological forms of public art that would self-destruct over time due to mechanical or chemical processes, thereby foregrounding the destructive forces embedded in societies depending on a dense net of technological support systems.
1960	Project OZMA	Cornell University	Named after the queen of the legendary land of Oz, project OZMA is the first attempt to detect interstellar radio transmissions that could be interpreted as traces of alien technology. The initial scan for signals from the stars Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridiani remains without result but marks the beginning of a series of related endeavors often subsumed under the acronym S.E.T.I (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence). With the emergence of the World Wide Web, the SETI@Home project launches one of the first initiatives to crowd-source scientific tasks to a growing community of Internet users. As of today, no traces of extraterrestrial intelligence have been identified.
1960	Scientific Citation Index	Eugene Garfield	Introduced to measure the impact of a scientific paper, the index helped to establish sciometry - the quantitative analysis of the effects of scientific papers - as a major method across sciences: It has been influential on computer based algorithmic information retrieval methods such as Google's page rank algorithm.
1961	Berlin Wall 	GDR government 	The western-controlled sectors of Berlin became an important loophole for inter-German migration during the first years of the “economic miracle”. In an attempt to stop the brain drain of the young, skilled and well-educated workforce, the GDR government started to construct a wall around West Berlin in the summer of 1961. The Berlin Wall became an important icon for western “freedom” and communist repression.
1961	Blue Sky above the Ruhr Valley	Willy Brandt	Brandt was the first major politician in post-war Germany who made environmental issues a major topic of his electorial campaign by demanding that "the sky above the Ruhr valley needs to become blue again". Signals an early shift away from post-war reconstruction towards more complex post-industrial orientation of politics.
1961	Les damnés de la terre (The Wretched of the Earth)	Frantz Fanon	In this book, Fanon, a distinguished psychiatrist from Martinique, investigated the social and psychological effects of colonialism from the point of view of the colonized. Major influence on the civil rights and de-colonial movements as well as theories of post-colonialism.
1961	The (anti-baby) Pill		The anti-baby pill, an oral contraceptive, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. By separating the issues of sex from getting pregnant, it induced a huge paradigm shift in moral values and sexual practices.
1962	Cuban Missile crisis		This Cold War crisis arose from Soviet deployment of nuclear weapons on Cuba in response to US missiles in Turkey and Italy. On the brink of nuclear war, fast communication between the superpowers became a priority (diplomatic messages took six hours to deliver and longer to decipher), which led to the signing of the Hot Line Agreement in June 1963. Game theory was applied by the USA to examine possible scenarios – the outcome is a compromise, as both withdrew their missiles from Cuba, and Turkey and Italy respectively. 
1962	First modem to transfer digital data over telephone lines		The Bell Dataphone 103, released in 1962, was the first modem to transfer digital data over telephone lines, with a top speed of 300 bits or 30 characters a second.
1962	Telstar		Telstar 1 was an experimental communications satellite in a non-stationary orbit. It provided the first transatlantic television feed as well as fax and telephone communications. 
1962	The Knowledge-based Economy	Fritz Machlup	The Austrian-American economist was the first to empirically measure the new concept of the "knowledge-based economy“. This idea of a shift in the structure of the economy was quickly adopted by policy makers and used to justify the outsourcing of manufacturing to low-wage countries.
1964	"Operaismo" (Workerism)	Toni Negri	The magazine Classe Operaia marked the beginning of "operaismo/workerism", a militant strand of new Marxism in Italy that developed key ideas about the changing nature of work in informational capitalism.
1964	Understanding Media	Marshall McLuhan	Pioneered the idea that media affect subjectivity, as well as the norms and values of society. He was the first to focus on the characteristics of the media, irrespective of the content ("The medium is the message") Major influence on the development of media studies. Rediscovered during the 1990s in the wake of the spread of the Internet.
1965	A Love Supreme	John Coltrane	This album marks a high point of what African American musicians called "the new thing" or "new black music", a form of improvised jazz closely linked to Black Consciousness and Black Power movements, but categorized as "free jazz" by white critics on the basis of formal musical characteristics only. 
1965	Efficient Market Hypothesis	Eugene Fama	Core economic hypothesis that states that prices reflect all available information and that it is impossible to outperform the market except by chance or high risk. Fama was awarded the 2013 Nobel Prize in Economics.
1965	ELIZA	Joseph Weizenbaum	An interactive program – the world's first chat bot – that holds a conversation in the English language simulating the dialogue of a psychotherapist with a patient. People's willingness to speak to speak with ELIZA surprised its creator and inspired his critique of Artificial Intelligence.
1965	Hypertext	Ted Nelson	Hypertext is the concept behind links on the web, influencing several developers of the Internet, most notably Tim Berners-Lee.
1965	Power outage in NY		Largest power outage in history blacks out New York City and parts of the North Western states. Following in history was the large blackout of 1977, which was almost on the same scale.
1965	Watts Riots		The largest urban rebellion of the U.S. Civil Rights era. It lasted for 6 days. Over 14,000 National Guard troops were mobilized. The riot started on August 11 in Watts, an impoverished African American neighborhood in South Central Los Angeles. Following an arrest, tensions between police officers and the crowd of onlookers erupted in a violent exchange.
1966	9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering'    	E.A.T. – Bell Labs    	E.A.T. - Experiments in Art and Technology was a series of performances, conceived by Robert Rauschenberg and Billy Klüvers, where artists collaborated with engineers from Bell Laboratories. Their collaboration produced many "firsts" in the use of new technology for the theater: closed-circuit television and projection was used on stage; a fibre-optics camera picked up objects in a performer's pocket; an infrared TV camera captured action in total darkness; a Doppler sonar device translated movement into sound; portable wireless FM transmitters and amplifiers transmitted speech and body sounds to loudspeakers.
1966	Tricontinental Conference 		At the 1955 Bandung conference, leaders from Asia and Africa met for the first time without European or American participation, and founded the movement of non-aligned nations (NAM) that neither belonged to the capitalist West nor to the Soviet-dominated East. The 1966 Tricontinental conference extended Afro-Asian solidarity into the Americas, marking a highpoint in the construction of a Third World anti-imperialist project. OSPAAAL was more radical than earlier efforts in its attempt to align anti-imperialism with a wider challenge to capitalism.
1967	Beat the Market: A Scientific Stock Market System	Edward O. Thorp, Shen S. Kassouf 	As a consequence of his success in pioneering probability theory in casino gambling, Edward O. Thorp took his findings to “the biggest casino in the world”: Wall Street. In the book, he reported on his experience as a financial engineer ("quant") who uses quantitative analysis techniques and computers to forecast stock market moves. He is therefore acknowledged as the “godfather of the quants”. 
1967	Picture of planet Earth taken from space	NASA	This picture was immediately taken up by a counter-culture to show the earth as an integrated, fragile system where borders play no role. It was featured on the cover of the first issue of the Whole Earth Catalog. Important for the emerging environmental movement.
1967	Small World Experiment	Stanley Milgram	A social psychologist, he conducted a (real-life) social network experiment in order to find average path lengths between two random individuals. The result, six degrees of separation, has become challenged in the age of online social networks where Facebook for example reports it to be around 3.57. The digitally connected world has become smaller.
1967	Society of the Spectacle	Guy Debord	The single most influential work by Debord, a member of the Situationist International. This group of European artists analyzed and deconstructed the role of the cultural industry in manipulating political consciousness in the consumer society through the production of spectacles. They invented subversive cultural techniques as the derivé (aimless drifting) and detournément (applying different meanings to known artifacts) that became widely used by numerous critical cultural movements, from punk to culture jamming.
1968	“The Mother of All Demos”	Douglas Engelbart	First demonstration of almost all the fundamental elements of modern personal computing: windows, hypertext, graphics, efficient navigation and command input, video conferencing, the computer mouse, word processing, dynamic file linking, revision control, and a collaborative real-time editor (collaborative work). This spawned similar projects at Xerox PARC in the early 1970s leading to the standard interface of personal computers.
1968	Cybernetic of Cybernetics	Heinz von Förster 	“To understand a brain, you need a brain”, with this legendary quote the Austrian physicist and philosopher Heinz von Förster (1911-2002) points out his idea of circularity, a fundamental principal of cybernetic thinking. Focusing on self-referential systems and the observer, he develops “second-order cybernetics,” highlighting the importance of self organisation and individual responsibility for all areas of life, technology and society. 
1968	Cybernetic Serendipity	Jasia Reichardt (curator)	A group exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London. One part of the exhibition was concerned with algorithms and devices for generating music. Some exhibits were pamphlets describing the algorithms, whilst others presented musical notation produced by computers. Devices made musical effects and played tapes of sounds made by computers. Another part described computer projects such as Gustav Metzger's self-destructive Five screens with computer, a design for a new hospital, a computer programmed structure, and dance choreography.
1968	May '68		Students and workers in Paris launched a new type of revolution. They did not aim at taking over power of the state but at dissolving power and hierarchies as such by revolutionizing everyday life. Similar revolts happened in many countries around the world, including socialist nations such as Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia where revolutionary ideas were also condoned from the top (Prague Spring).
1968	Tendencies 4: Computers and Visual Research	New Tendencies	The exhibition and symposium Computers and Visual Research, August 2-8, 1968, opened in Zagreb one day after Cybernetic Serendipity. It presented an overview of computer generated artwork to date. The international network and movement New Tendencies approached computer graphics from the point of view of "visual research", exploring connections between analog, "programmed art" based on Gestalt psychology principles and computer based visual research.
1968	The Population Bomb 	Paul Ralph Ehrlich 	It was the best seller version of the Neo-Malthusian warnings that became more and more popular through the 1950s and 60s. The growth of agricultural production would not keep pace with the growth of population. Rigorous family planning was advocated to avoid this scenario.
1969	ARPANET (predecessor of the Internet)	JCR Licklider et al. 	This network, that has evolved into the Internet we know today, went online in 1969, connecting four US universities, UCLA, Stanford Research Institute (SRI), UC Santa Barbara (UCSB), and the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.
1969	First Human on the Moon  	NASA Apollo program	It was estimated that one out of five humans followed the live broadcast of the Apollo 11 landing on the moon in 1969. The carefully staged TV pictures became a widely used propaganda tool stating the dominance of capitalism over the communist USSR who had previously been leading in the "space race". Earth seen from space (blue planet) became an important symbol for environmentalism. 
1969	First quantitative hedge fund 	Convertible Hedge Associates (Edward O. Thorp and Jay Regan)	Hedge funds are largely unregulated entities and therefore apply so-called market-neutral strategies: Quantitative (mathematical) models and methods exploit market inefficiencies by making highly-concentrated bets while limiting market exposure through a combination of (statistical) arbitrage and long/short positions.
1969	General System Theory	Ludwig von Bertalanffy	In contrast to the closed systems of physics governed by entropy, biological systems are considered by von Bertalanffy as open systems maintaining steady state. As such they could be described by cybernetics. However, von Bertalanffy distanced his approach from Wiener’s machinic cybernetic concept, instead advocating that open systems organize in complex ways in order to keep steady state and obey a more general form of thermodynamics (negative entropy).
1969	Genital Panic	Valie Export	In this photographic performance the artist poses with trousers which have been cut to expose the pubic area, while at the same time holding a machine gun. The work asserts the female artist's self-definition vis-a-vis the male gaze and is an exemplary work of a new wave of feminist art which contributed to a wider shift in the perception of gender stereotypes.
1969	Stonewall riots		A series of violent demonstrations following a police raid, on June 28, on the most popular gay bar in New York, the Stonewall Inn. These riots expressed the will to fight back against repression rather than to hide and ingnited the modern gay and lesbian movement.
1969	UNIX (computer operating system)	Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie et al.	Unix is an operating system whose basic concept is still in place today, as a multi-tasking, multi-user system where many small programs are strung together through a command-line interface called a shell. Unix and its successors, the various flavours of its free alternative Linux, are the operating systems of choice for software developers and for professional applications such as web servers.
1969	When Attitudes become Form	Harald Szeemann	The exhibition marked the conceptual turn in art: The transition from late modern practices to dematerialized post-modern practices. According to English art philosopher Peter Osborne, this was the last really big paradigm change in fine art that is still in place today; first large group show of contemporary art with corporate sponsoring by Phillip Morris Company.
1969	Woodstock		The music festival, advertised as "An Aquarian Exposition: 3 Days of Peace & Music", attracted an audience of 400,000 people. It was a major manifestation of the new values of hippie and pacifist counter-culture in the context of the Vietnam War.
1970	Bitches Brew	Miles Davis	The album fused jazz with electric and electronic instruments and studio post-production elements such as tape loops, delays and echo chambers. It represents a high-point of afro-futurism.
1970	Information (Exhibition)	Kynaston McShine (curator)	Held at MoMA in New York it presented videos and installations by 100 American and European artists, mainly from the field of conceptual art. It included an early example of art engaging with publicly accessible archives. Some of the participating artists confronted the issues of political and media based contents: Hans Haacke established MOMA POLL as a first link between the areas of politics and the museum by presenting an open poll system. 
1970	PARC (Palo Alto Research Center)	 	PARC, a division of Xerox Corporation, was founded. Many of the building blocks of the modern personal computer and the graphical user interface (GUI) were developed there.
1970	Phone Phreaking	John Draper alias Captain Crunch	He used a toy whistle to gain access to the AT&T telephone switches, enabling him to make free phone calls and conferences, creating an early computing  subculture. This had a major impact on the emerging computer industry, for example, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak developed phreaking devices before founding Apple Inc.
1970	Software (Exhibition)	Jack Burnham (curator)	The show introduced the concept of software as a metaphor for art and presented works by conceptual artists and computer scientists together. According to its curator, computer artists and conceptual artists gave preference and heightened importance to software defined as the expression of an idea that becomes reality by simulating it.
1970	The Container		After being developed by Malcolm McLean in the 1950s, the modern freight container was fully standardized by International Standards Organistion. This reduced both loading and unloading time, undermining the power of the dockers' union. Efficient transport through containers played a large part in the quadrupling of world trade since 1970.
1970	Transcendental Conceptualism	OHO (art group)	The works by OHO carried out in the context of the Information exhibition were termed "transcendental conceptualism" by Tomas Brejc. By using methods of chance, the group members tried to demonstrate telepathic connections across continents as a comment to the emerging sphere of global communication.
1971	Casual Passer-by I met	Braco Dimitrijević	Series of works wherein a passer-by met by the artists is photographed and shown in public space; undermined conventions of image display in socialist society; work seen as a precursor of social media by presenting faces of ordinary people; together with other works in former Yugoslavia, it marks a determined shift away from the principles of hope offered by the Marxist utopia.
1971	End of the Gold Standard	Richard Nixon, US President	Effectively ended the post-war economic order (Bretton Woods) and introduced a new system of flexible exchange rates of freely floating fiat currencies as the basis of world economy.
1971	First Microprocessor	Intel Corporation	The first microprocessor, the Intel 4004, contained all functions of a computer on a tiny chip. Initially commissioned for a Japanese electronic calculator, it significantly drove down the cost of computing. This chip, and its successors, were soon being used in a wide range of machines – including some of the first home personal computers. These chips mark "the big bang of the information revolution" (Carlota Perez). 
1971	NASDAQ	The National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations 	The NASDAQ was the first electronic stock market worldwide. It began as an automated quotation system but quickly developed into a full-fledged marketplace. It is the second largest exchange by market capitalizaition today. 
1971	Project Cybersyn	Stafford Beer	The British cyberneticist built a computer network for the Chilean socialist government of Salvador Allende. Its goal was to provide real-time management of the economy from a central operations room. The US supported military coup on September 11, 1973 effectively ended Cybersyn and cybernetic socialism, instead turning Chile into a laboratory for neoliberalism.
1971	Project Gutenberg	Michael S. Hart	This is the oldest digital library, a volunteer effort to digitize and archive cultural works, to “encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks”. Most of the items in its collection are the full texts of public domain books. As of April 2015, Project Gutenberg has over 49,200 items in its collection.
1972	Autopoiesis	Humberto Maturana, Francisco Varela	Under the socialist presidency (S. Allende, 1970-73) in Chile, the two cell biologists develop the concept of "autopoeisis" (Greek for "self" and "creation"). By this they mean a system, such as a cell, that is functionally closed, but coupled with the environment, from which it takes all the necessary elements to (re)produce itself. While building on Cybernetics and General Systems Theory, they add a key element to it: autonomy. Each autopoietic system "can specify its own rules, what is proper to it." (1987:8) This marks a shift away from the focus on control of first-order cybernetics towards a horizontal view of self-organized systems interacting with each other.
1972	Hip Hop, Breakbeats and the "Merry-Go-Round" (sampling with Turntables)	DJ Kool Herc	Clive Campbell, a Jamaica born DJ in NYC, Bronx, started using turntables to create loops of break-beats, "percussion only" passages in funk, soul, disco and Latin music. This practice is an important precursor of Hip Hop, and provided the basis for appropriation and looping as cultural techniques foundational for the information age. 
1972	Lenin in Budapest	Bálint Szombáthy	By carrying a poster of Lenin – the leader of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 – through Budapest, the artist revealed the socialist revolution as at the same time a lost dream and a society on which the bureaucratic order of the party was imposed; marks the break of artists with the socialist utopia by displaying its icons in the trivial everyday life of "actually existing socialism." 
1972	Musée d'Art Moderne, Départment des Aigles	Marcel Broodthaers	Marcel Broodthaers presents his seminal Installation "Musée d'Art Moderne, Départment des Aigles" at the Documenta V in Kassel. The long term project of a “museum” run by the artist, which began in 1968, enables a specific form of institutional critique. At the Documenta V, Broodthaers presents a collection of objects and materials entirely based on the concept of the eagle thus organizing an informational approach to cultural production in the context of fine art.
1972	Pong	Atari	Pong, programmed by Allan Alcorn in 1972, and based on table tennis, is the first commercially successful arcade video game machine, which helped to establish the video game industry.
1972	The Limits to Growth	Club of Rome	Based on computer simulation, this study tried to forecast the effects of exponential growth on a world of limited resources. It triggered a debate about natural limits to unrestrained economic development and its impact on the environment. The report represents the growing ecological consciousness in Western industrial countries. 
1972	Watergate		The arrest of five burglars in the headquarter of the Democratic Party in the Watergate building complex led to revelations about widespread abuse of power by president Richard Nixon, including secret wiretapping at the White House. Drawing on an anonymous source called Deep Throat, investigative reporters followed the money trail to the top of the Nixon administration. This led to widespread distrust of the American political establishment and a crisis of legitimacy.
1973	Audiovisual Messages	Trigon Festival	The exhibition, shown as part of Trigon festival, was the first large scale exhibition in central Europe dedicated to artists working with video. With specially commissioned works by, among others, Gianni Colombo, Sania Iveković, Dalibor Martinis, Nusra and Sreco Dragan.   
1973	Black-Scholes-Merton model (BSM)	Fisher Black, Myron Scholes, Robert C. Merton 	Its mathematical equation gives the theoretically risk-free price for an option. Probability theory applied to betting on market movements changed the attitude towards derivatives from immoral gambling to a scientific and rational activity. Even though the model's hypothesis was falsified during the 1987 market crash, Scholes and Merton received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1997 (Black had died before). BSM had to be calculated on a computer, which initially impeded its use on trading floors. When Joseph Ritchie programmed the formula into a hand-held calculator (1975), it became the paradigmatic tool every trader still uses.
1973	Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)		The CBOE is the first marketplace for trading listed options. After the end of Bretton Woods, hedging and speculation became the new business model for managing risk and price expectations. Information was crucial, which led to computerization and new institutions (marketplaces). This initiated a growth in derivative markets, products and models that is ongoing.
1973	End of Bretton Woods 		After the abandonment of the gold standard, the pegging of currencies to the U.S. dollar was ended for good. Currencies became free floating and exchange rates volatile. This prompted the development of new risk management methods. Derivative markets proliferated due to a mindset that saw speculation as inherent to free markets.
1973	Filosofía de la liberación	Enrique Dussel	The philosophy of liberation – a book title as well as a collective effort in the name of liberation, autonomy and authenticity – is a major strand within post-colonial discourse. It aims to think the distinct world historical character of Latin America out of economic, cultural, political dependency. It is a critique of imperialism, colonialism, globalization, racism, and sexism articulated from the experience of exploitation, destitution, alienation, and reification. According to Dussel, there will be no future apart from the liberation of the periphery.
1973	OPEC Oil Crisis		In response to American-led Western support for Israel in the Yom Kippur War, the Organization of Oil Exporting Countries enacted an oil export embargo. This exacerbated an already looming crisis of Keynesian Fordism, prompting the intensification of a paradigm change towards neoliberalism. The event also marked the beginning of a rising influence of a radical form of Islam from Saudi Arabia.
1973	Post-Industrial Society	Daniel Bell	Influential book arguing that a shift towards information processing is transforming economy, politics and culture in Western societies. 
1973	Remote Frequency Identification (RFID)		Two key patents for modern Radio Frequency Identification technology granted in the US. RFID became a key infrastructure for global logistics and real time tracking of objects, animals and humans (for example, through ankle monitors).
1973	Television Delivers People	Richard Serra	A short film made by artist Richard Serra. Working alongside Carlota Fay Schoolman, the two artists bought some airtime to broadcast the piece to the public. The text of this piece of video art is a critique of mass media and pop culture as a control tactic and social construct.
1974	Autobahn	Kraftwerk	The first of a series of recordings by the German band Kraftwerk which pioneers a new synthetic musical style using synthesizers, drum machines and a purpose-built vocoder. They deeply influenced New Wave synthesizer music, Hip Hop, Electro, House and Techno Music. 
1974	Petrodollars		In 1974 a USA-Saudi alliance fixed the dollar as the only currency for oil trade in the OPEC system. This, in combination with the high oil prices, increased the amount of free floating capital, the so-called "petrodollars", which were channeled into loans by US banks for emerging economies, thus contributing to the global finance system.
1974	Recombinant DNA	Stanford University	The patent application of Stanford University for recombinant DNA marks a turning point: rDNA allows for the moving of sequences of genetic information across the barriers of species and genus.
1974	Relational Database (SQL)		In 1974 the first specification for SQL (Structured Query Language) was published. SQL is the leading technology behind the "database revolution" (Big Data) as well as a basis of data storage and retrieval in the 21st century.
1974	The Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)	Vint Cerf, Bob Kahn	Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (TC/IP) is a suite of protocols that form the technological core of the Internet. The layered architecture of those protocols ensures the net's capacity for decentral self-organisation and its neutrality (data packets are passed on regardless of content or destination).
1974	TV Buddha	Nam June Paik	With his seminal "closed-circuit" video installation TV Buddha, Nam Jun Paik presents one of the canonical pieces of early video art, which engages with the specificities of television as a live medium.
1974	Universal Product Code on Barcodes		The (optical) Universal Product Code on barcodes was created by IBM consultant George Laurer. It followed the introduction of the first barcode scanner in 1972 and together with the container it effected a global revolution in logistics.
1975	Angola and Mozambique Independence		After close to 500 years of Portuguese rule, these two territories gain formal independence. This marks the end of European colonialism as formal political system.
1975	Fristenlösung (Legal Abortion) in Austria 	AUF (Aktion Unabhängiger Frauen), SPÖ (Social Democrats)	Abortion became legalized in Austria under certain conditions. One of a series of victories of the new womens movements in many countries.This right of control over their own body was hard fought for by women and continues to be controversial in some countries.
1975	Genetic Algorithms	John Holland	This book established the field of genetic algorithms. Today, they play an important role in studies of complex adaptive systems. Applications range from adaptive agents in economic theory to machine learning techniques used in the design of complex technologies and Big Data processing. 
1975	New York City Bankruptcy		The city administration was forced into a technical bankruptcy when it found itself unable to refinance its debt. The conditions of the bailout forced a restructuring of the public institutions, curbing the power of unions, introducing tuition fees at public colleges and dismantling the welfare state. This served as a template for neo-liberal policies around the world.
1975	Semiotics of the Kitchen	Martha Rosler	In this video, Rosler works herself through an alphabet of expressions relating to the kitchen, whereby she "replaces the domesticated 'meaning' of tools with a lexicon of rage and frustration." The piece has become an icon of feminist video art.
1976	Animal Liberation Front	Ronnie Lee	An international, clandestine, leaderless resistance engaging in illegal direct action in pursuit of animal rights. Activists see themselves as a modern-day Underground Railroad, removing animals from labs and farms, destroying facilities, arranging safe houses and veterinary care, and operating sanctuaries where the animals subsequently live. It marks a major radicalization in the animal rights movement and a new type underground organisation, rejecting centralized leadership and command.

While the finding of exoplanets does not ensure their habitability, the discovery signals a sea change in the world view towards extra-terrestrial life, from a dead universe with life only on Earth to a growing belief that we are not alone. This shift is supported by other findings, such as Cassini data that point to the existence of liquid water on Saturn’s moon Enceladus.
