1900	Théorie de la Spéculation 	Louis Bachelier	First financial theory based on advanced mathematics derived from natural processes (such as Brownian motion that was also adopted by Albert Einstein for his relativity theory 5 years later). Bachelier's approach was largely ignored and preceded the so-called Black-Scholes-Merton model (1973) by over 70 years, which triggered the multibillion-dollar industry of derivative option trading and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1997. 
1901	Radio Transmission	Guglielmo Marconi	First transatlantic radio transmission, demonstrating the possibility of wireless communication. Hopes of peace due to better communication did not materialize. Like all subsequent communication technologies, it transformed but could not prevent social conflicts.
1901	Wandervögel	Herman Hoffmann Fölkersamb	Created as a back-to-nature youth organization in Germany emphasizing freedom, self-responsibility, and the spirit of adventure. It was a reaction to the materialism, hypocrisy, and stifling social conservatism of the Wilhelminian Reich. Most Wandervögel ('birds of passage') came from well-to-do middle-class families. It's both one of the first youth movements and modern counter-cultures. 
1904	National Child Labor Committee (US)	Edgar Gardner Murphy	The foundation of this committee marks the beginning of the modern children's rights movement. According to the 1900 US Census, 1 of 6 children between 5 and 10 years old was engaged in wage labor. The immediate goal was to abolish child labor nationwide. This was achieved in 1938 when the "Fair Labor Standards Act" was signed into law in the context of the New Deal reforms.
1905	Russo-Japanese War		A twenty months long war over over rival imperial ambitions in Manchuria and Korea ends with the defeat of Russia. This was the first defeat of a European country against a non-European adversary in modern history and marked the end of the colonial expansion towards the East. It revealed the weakness of the Czarist regime and triggered the first Russian revolution.  
1905	The Special Theory of Relativity	Albert Einstein	Overturning the paradigm of Newtonian physics, which had been dominant for 200 years, relativity theory has changed basic conceptions of space and time. It established the notion of an upper speed limit equivalent to the speed of light and had numerous repercussions for atomic physics, nuclear physics, and quantum mechanics. It also had implications for the way in which we see the world reaching far beyond physics and natural sciences, establishing freedom, openness and indeterminacy as fundamental categories of human knoweldge. 
1909	First modern securitization 	Samuel W. Straus	The first time a financial instrument combined different assets (a mortgage bond with a senior tranche).  Securitization transforms illiquid asset(s) into a security. The principle behind Mortgage-Backed Securities in the 2008 subprime crisis: mortgages are combined into one large pool that's divided into smaller pieces based on each mortgage's risk of default and then sold to investors. The aim is to enable smaller investors to purchase shares in a larger asset pool, but risks are hard to monitor due to its complexity.  
1910	The Mundaneum	Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine	An institution based in Brussels to house all the knowledge of the world on 3x5" index cards. It flourished in the interwar period but declined after the German invasion of Belgium. Today, it is seens as an analog predecessor to the Internet. In 2012 Google announced a cooperation with the institution, today based in Mons, Belgium. 
1911	Taylorism	Frederick W. Taylor	In Principles of Scientific Management Taylor set out a method for rationalizing factory production by adapting the movement of the workers to the rhythms of the machine. Laid the groundwork for the assembly line production. Among his greatest admirers were Henry Ford and Vladimir Ilyich Lenin.
1913	The Assembly Line at Highland Park	Henry Ford	The assembly line production system at Ford Motor Company combined a number of earlier innovations in the American System of Manufacture to create a seamless production process along an assembly line. It significantly reduced cost per unit but also heightened the class antagonism and resulted in an unsustainably high turnover rate of workers. 
1914	Federal Reserve 		Foundation of U.S. Federal Reserve System, which is based on public/private ownership. The Federal Reserve Act was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson in 1913. Initialized the establishment of central banks as providers of credit, currency, money supply, and interest rates. Additionally of central banks act as lenders of last resort.
1914	First World War 		The first fully industrial war began, mobilizing all sectors of societies under military command, creating an unprecedented scale of destruction. It effectively ended the dominance of the British Empire and its ideology of free-trade, replacing them with an unstable system of nationalistic states that championed industrial and scientific innovation as a means of strengthening their competitive base. 
1915	Black Square	Kazimir Malevich	This painting of a black square, carried out in oil on linen, is considered a point zero of modern art, since it ended the paradigm of representation in visual art. Concurrent with similar tendencies in art in the Netherlands and Germany – as well as new scientific findings such as quantum physics – the painting marked a step to the construction of a new reality on an abstract plane, based on notions of universal and inalienable human values. 
1915	Fordism	Henry Ford	On January 5, 1915, Henry Ford announced the 5$ day, doubling the standard daily wage. The Ford system of production produced not only cars but also a new type of worker. Workers had to meet company standards for clean living, including sobriety, no gambling, thrift, and a happy home environment. In exchange, they were able to buy the products they built, expanding the consumer market.
1917	Fountain	Marcel Duchamp	This urinal turned upside down is submitted to, and initially rejected by the exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists, New York. As a "ready made" it reflected the paradigmatic shift from artisanal towards industrial production of everyday goods from the perspective of the artist, and became one of the most influential artworks of the 20st century. 
1917	October Revolution	Vladimir Ilyich Lenin	The October Revolution enabled the creation of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics (USSR) which formed a political counter-weight to the market-oriented West for 70 years. This had significant repercussions not only in Western politics but also in scientific and technological research and development strategies.
1918	First Drone	Charles Kettering	Unmanned “flying bomb” known as the Kettering Aerial Torpedo or the “Kettering Bug,” that was designed to hit a target at a range of 40 miles. It did not become functional during WWI,yet was part of the militarization of the air which became increasingly important.
1918	Universal Suffrage 		Women achieved the right to vote in many European countries in 1918-19.This ended a long 19th century struggle for “Equal and Common Suffrage” first for men, and later for women. The expansion of suffrage was a worldwide phenomenon throughout the following century. Restrictions based on race and ethnicity generally proved to be most resistant. The indigenous people of Australia had to wait till 1962 for their inclusion into the electorate, in the US most Black Americans till the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
1920	The Original Ponzi Scheme	Charles Ponzi	Charles Ponzi purchased postal coupons at a discount and sold them for full price, claiming the coupons would produce a 50% profit in 45 days. He paid investors from the proceeds of subsequent ones until the pyramid scheme finally blew up. "Ponzi scheme" has become the household word for fraudulent 'snow ball' schemes, among which the Enron scandal and the Bernie Madoff fraud case are the most infamous ones.
1921	Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit    	Frank H. Knight	A crucial distinction is introduced here in modern economic thinking as well as financial market practice: between risk (where outcomes are unknown but governed by probability distributions) and uncertainty (were also the latter are unknown). He was one of the founders of the Mont Pelerin Society and the Chicago School of economics, the main voices of neoliberalism.
1922	Rise of fascism in Europe	Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler et al. 	In 1922, the Italian fascist Mussolini formed a government and in 1925 declared himself "duce" (leader). In 1933, Hitler was appointed German chancellor, the National Socialists took full power as the only legal political party later that year. Other European countries like Austria and Spain followed. Fascist regimes focused heavily on information technology and propaganda to consolidate power; developed early mass media such as radio to influence and control the population; and poured money into a technological military build-up for war. 
1922	Telephone Pictures	László Moholy-Nagy	The first use of telecommunications as an artistic medium by the Hungarian constructivist artist Moholy-Nagy. This work questioned the idea of the isolated individual artist and the unique art object.
1923	Enigma Encryption Machine	Arthur Scherbius, Alan Turing	This machine could encipher and decipher secret coded messages. One of its follower models was used by Nazi Germany in the Second World War. A team of mathematicians including Alan Turing together with female operators and an early, analog computer managed to break the Enigma code. This turned the submarine war in favor of the Allied forces and has been credited with shortening the war by two years.
1925	ISOTYPE	Otto Neurath, Gerd Arntz and Marie Reidemeister	The International System of Typographic Picture Education ISOTYPE was developed starting in 1925 by Neurath, Arntz and Reidemeister at the Viennese Museum of Society and Economy. The goal was to use a visual method for popular education about complex political, social and economic issues. Isotype is still in use today and has experienced a renaissance in data journalism and information graphics.
1927	The Hawthorne Effect	Elton Mayo	A group of researchers from Harvard Business School conducted a series of studies into labour relations and workplace arrangements concluding that workers did better work when they received more attention as human beings - the Hawthorne Effect. After WWII those findings became the trigger of the human relations movement. Although originally conceived in industrial surroundings, the new methods were mostly applied to white collar workers.
1928	Soviet central planning: First Five Year Plan		Stalin introduced the first Five Year Plan for a rapid industrialization of Soviet Economy. It caused millions of deaths, especially through forced collectivization in agriculture, but also enabled the Soviets to withstand the assault of Hitler's high-tech army. The planned economy was for many years seen as a successful model, especially by poorer countries, for catching up with industrialization; forced the West into a systemic competition which eventually led to the creation of information society.   
1929	"Black Tuesday" stock market crash		On October 24, a stock market crash ended the post-World War I economic boom. The "Roaring Twenties" had been a time of prosperity and progress prompted by Fordism and stock market gambling. Over $30 billion were lost in two days. This shock heralded the start of the Great Depression, which affected most industrialized countries in the following decades. While financial regulation was strengthened in its wake, many controls have been rescinded again since the 1980s.
1929	Man with a Movie Camera	Dziga Vertov,  Elizaveta Svilova	An experimental silent documentary film, with no story and no actors. It is famous for the range of cinematic techniques Vertov invented, deployed or developed. It signalled the end of linear techniques of narration that dominated the Western culture of the Gutenberg Galaxy.
1929	Process and Reality	Alfred North Whitehead	Whitehead introduced a speculative philosophy that he called philosophy of organism: "... diverge from Descartes by holding that what he has described as primary attributes of physical bodies, are really the forms of internal relationships between actual occasions."
1930	A Treatise on Money 	John Maynard Keynes	In the Treatise Keynes drew a distinction between savings and investment, arguing that where saving exceeded investment, recession would occur. Thus, Keynes reasoned that during a depression the best course of action would be to promote spending and to discourage saving. Keynes ideas signalled a new form for the state to influence economies and were dominant until the 1970s. 
1930	Der Rundfunk als Kommunikationsapparat	Berthold Brecht	Part of Brecht's theoretical enquiry into radio as a device of mass media communication. He demanded that each receiver should also be a transmitter. It was an important theoretical reference for media activists in the 1970s and the 1990s.
1931	Sociography (Marienthal Study)	Paul F. Lazarsfeld, Marie Jahoda et al.	This study into the patterns of unemployed people helped to establish the method of sociography in the social sciences. By meticulously investigating behavioral patterns of long-term unemployed in everyday life, the initiators hoped to establish new ways of social reform. Foundational for a range of disciplines which converged into social network analysis since the 1980s and is now used in heavily quantified form by social media platforms for the purpose of profit seeking. 
1933	Glass-Steagall Banking Act	Congressional sponsors: Senator Carter Glass (D) of Virginia, and Representative Henry B. Steagall (D) of Alabama.	In the wake of the 1929 market crash, the law's provisions separated the activities of commercial banking (deposits and loans) and investment banking (securities such as stocks and bonds) in order to separate risks and introduce a healthier financial system. The law was repealed in 1999 during the Clinton administration.
1933	Hollerith Machine  	IBM Germany	This machine provided indispensable technologic assistance for the industrialized destruction of human life by Nazi Germany. More than 2,000 such multi-machine sets were dispatched throughout Germany, and thousands more throughout German-dominated Europe. Card sorting operations were established in every major concentration camp. People were moved from place to place, systematically worked to death, and their remains catalogued with icy automation. 
1933	La Radia Manifesto	Felipe Tommasi Marinetti, Pino Masata	This futurist manifesto pointed towards the future of electronic communication, inviting disembodiment, interference and the emergence of a new form of audience.
1933	New Deal	 Franklin D. Roosevelt	Series of programs enacted by presidential executive order as well as laws passed by Congress in response to the Great Depression, the most profound economic crisis of the 20th century. Replaced laissez-faire economics. State orchestrated regulation and intervention generated an economic upturn with full employment achieved in 1941. Provided the post-World War II framework of Keynesian Fordism.
1935	Welfare State		Enacted as part of the New Deal, the US-American Social Security Act is the foundation of what would become the welfare state of the post-WW II era. Sweden introduced a similar, though more extensive regulation in 1936, creating the Scandinavian model of the welfare state. 
1936	Summer Olympics Berlin	German Post Office	First televised international sports event, utilized as a propaganda vehicle by the Nazi regime. They installed a closed-circuit television system and radio network that reached 41 countries, with many other forms of expensive high-tech electronic equipment.
1936	The Gallup Poll	George Gallup	The Roosevelt administration had a heightened interest in public opinion after the introduction of the New Deal. The new method developed by George Gallup to statistically gather the opinion of a representative sample of society was the only one to correctly predict the re-election of President Roosevelt in 1936.
1936	The Turing Machine 	Alan Turing	The Turing machine is a hypothetical device that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. The Turing machine was not intended as practical computing technology, but contained the idea of the computer in abstract form.
1936	The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction (or Reproducibility)	Walter Benjamin	This essay discussed the shifts of perception of the work of art in relation to technologies of reproduction and mass media dissemination, such as photography and film. 
1938	Colloque Walter Lippmann – inception of neoliberalism.  	Louis Rougier 	This conference in Paris was the birth date of both the concept and the term “neoliberalism” (proposed by the German economist Alexander Rüstow) as a categorical rejection of collective socialism, fascism, and classic laissez-faire liberalism. It inspired Friedrich Hayek’s first Mont Pelerin meeting after WW II.
1938	Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)	Albert Hoffmann, Sandoz	The drug, advocated by intellectuals such as Aldous Huxley and Timothy Leary, produced altered states of consciousness which made people wanting to drop out of Fordist disciplinary society; contributed to "Summer of Love". Slogan: "tune in, turn on, drop out."
1938	The Programme Analyzer 	Paul Lazarsfeld, Frank Stanton	They invented a device for measuring audience satisfaction. Listeners could press a green or red button to express their (dis)satisfaction at a particular point. While invented for radio, it was soon applied for film and other media, contributing to quantitative sociological research into the perception of media by audiences.
1939	World War II		Following a short period of peace under the sign of the Great Depression, Germany started the most devastating violent conflict in human history to date. At the end of the war, a new world order had been established, effectively separating the world in U.S. and Soviet (hemi-)spheres of influence
1942	Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy	Joseph Schumpeter	Among other themes, the book deals with entrepreneurism, creative destruction (a term Schumpeter coined) and the demise of capitalism. It has become one of the most influential books on economy and social theory in general and especially for the New Economy of the "Silicon Valley".  
1942	Manhattan Project	J. Robert Oppenheimer et al.	Between 1942 and 1946 the first atomic bomb was developed by the USA with the help of the UK. This effort was based on a previously unprecedented integration of scientific research and military organisation, bringing together, besides Oppenheimer, mathematical geniuses such as John von Neumann and triggering the design of the US version of the world's first computer.
1942	Mertonian norms in science	Robert K. Merton 	This founding figure of the sociology of science codified the ethics of the scientific community expressed in the acronym CUDOS: c for communism, u for universalism, d for disinterestedness and o for organised skepticism. It expressed the idea that scientists act in the common, universal human interest rather than for particular groups and their purposes. 
1942	Z4 digital computer	Konrad Zuse	The Z4 was an electromechanical computer built between 1942 and 1945. In 1945 it was used at an aerodynamical research institute that worked for German Luftwaffe. Together with the Colossus, built in England, and the ENIAC, built in the USA, it was one of three "first" digital computing machines ever built. 
1944	A pioneering woman in computer science	Grace Murray Hopper	Grace Murray Hopper, an American computer scientist and navy rear admiral, was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer in 1944. She invented the first compiler for a computer programming language, and was one of those who popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages. She is credited with popularizing the term “debugging” for fixing computer glitches.
1944	Bretton Woods System established 		The postwar economic order was established in this agreement; made the U.S. dollar the de-facto world reserve currency by tying it to gold; the currencies of member states were flexibly pegged to the dollar. Other main components were the creation of the International Monetary Fund as lender of last resort and of the International Bank of Reconstruction (now World Bank); created the basis for the stability of the postwar economic order.
1944	The Great Transformation	Karl Polanyi	To Polanyi, the modern market economy and the modern nation state are a single human invention: the "market society". The creation of capitalist institutions not only changed laws but also altered humankind's economic mentalities – after the great transformation people became more economically rational while before they had based their economies on reciprocity and redistribution.
1945	Atomic Bomb	Robert Oppenheimer	First atomic bomb detonated by the United States. Bombs have been dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. For the first time, it became conceivable that mankind could destroy the entire planet Earth.
1945	The Memex 	Vannevar Bush	The paper "As We May Think" envisioned a universal networked library that anticipated the Internet. It should allow users to link together and view microfilm documents and thus represents one of the first concepts of Hypertext which now underpins the WWW. Bush's ideas inspired pioneers such as J.C.R. Licklider, Douglas Engelbart and Ted Nelson.
1945	The Use of Knowledge in Society	Friedrich Hayek	Hayek conceives the market doctrine of the neoliberal agenda. It is a precursor to the efficient market hypothesis: The market is defined as the only place where “all relevant information is concentrated” with the price system (a spontaneous order) coordinating the “utilization of knowledge not given to anyone in its totality." This vision replaced Keynesianism since the end of the 1970s.
1945	Von Neumann Architecture	John von Neumann	This paper described a method for a computer, which can, aside from other things, keep data and program instructions in memory. This made computers programmable and defined their architecture to this day.
1946	Focus Groups - Motivational Research 	Ernst Dichter	Although pioneered by Lazarsfeld, Dichter perfected the technique of focus group research into products and brands by merging it with Freudian depth-analysis into unconscious elements of the subject-product relation.
1946	Nuclear Overkill		The term refers to the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union. It was in common use during the Cold War era since both nations possess more than enough nuclear weapons to destroy one another many times over. Technological change was the foremost external dynamic to the evolution of the nuclear strategy in the early Cold War. 
1947	Iron Curtain - Start of the Cold War	Joseph Stalin, Harry S Truman, Winston Churchill 	The Iron Curtain, a metaphor coined by Winston Churchill in 1946, became a reality in 1947, after Joseph Stalin installed Communist governments controlled from Moscow in all countries liberated from Nazi occupation by the Red Army. This effectively separated the world into two large power blocs initiating the Cold War that lasted untill 1989.
1947	Mont Pelerin Society	Friedrich Hayek	Major think tank and network for the development of neoliberal economics and policies that convenes every year since 1947. It was instrumental in spreading neoliberalism. Eight of its members received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, George Stigler, James M. Buchanan, Maurice Allais, Gary Becker, Ronald Coase, Vernon Smith).
1947	Transistor	John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley	Invention of a semiconductor that amplifies signals at Bell Labs by Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockely (earlier research by Julius Lilienfeld, patent filed 1925) who were awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics "for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect." The transistor revolutionized the field of electronics.
1948	"Baby": The World's first stored-program Computer		"Baby" - official name Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM) - was the world's first stored-program computer. It was built in Manchester by a team that was later joined by Alan Turing who used its successor model to write generative software that simulated the development of skin patterns by animals (morphogenesis). 
1948	Cybernetics	Norbert Wiener	This book introduced the term cybernetics, from Greek "kybernetes" (steersman), referrring to the capacity of living systems and machines to sustain themselves through information used in feedback loops. Cybernetics together with systems theory established a new paradigm which sees people, animals, plants and machines as information processors reacting to changes in an open environment. Influencing various other sciences, it became foundational for the epistemology of the information society.
1948	Information Theory	Claude E. Shannon	The mathematical theory of communication, better known as information theory, created a mathematical model for the transmission of information. It also created a powerful scheme to thematize communication, the sender - channel - receiver scheme, which became influential far beyond information theory as such, affecting theories of cognition and even art and literature.
1948	Musique Concrète	Pierre Schaeffer	With "Étude aux chemins de fer," Schaeffer used early technologies to compose music consisting of a series of successive sound extracts. Musique concrète breaks down the structured production of traditional instruments at their roots with sounds from recordings of musical instruments, voice, the natural environment as well as synthesizers and signal processing.
1949	Hedge Fund	Alfred W. Jones	The first investment fund that bought stock while selling other stock short – a risk management practice Jones termed a “hedge” (financial lingo for limiting one’s risks).
1949	Le Deuxième Sexe	Simone de Beauvoir	Foundational work for the second wave of feminism. Established the anti-essentialist view that being a woman is not a matter of biology but of politics and culture.
1950	Credit Card	Ralph Schneider and Frank McNamara	Diners Club became the first general purpose credit card which established the model of consumer credit, short-term loans for goods and services for personal use.
1950	Kidney Transplant		First successful kidney transplant at Little Company of Mary Hospital, Illinois. The first recorded transplant of a liver was in 1933 in the Soviet Union, where the patient died two days later. Following were transplantations of livers (1963), lungs (1964) and hearts (1964).
1950	World Population: 2,5 Billion people		Average annual rate of population change in the period 1950-55: 1,77%. Population growth was still predominantly valuated highly by national politicial and economic elites – as a source of military power and an important base for economic growth.
1951	Biennale of São Paulo		The first international fine arts biennial outside of Europe. Kickstarts the globalization of modern and contemporary art.
1951	Toyotism / Kaizen	Ohno Taiichi	Car company Toyota implemented a range of methods for better integration of all members of the workforce in innovation processes (Kaizen), and for a closer integration of the workflow. Laid the foundations for Toyota overtaking US car producers in the 1980s; inaugurated new management philosophies of "lean production" and "just-in-time" systems.
1952	4′33″ (Silent Piece)	John Cage	The score of this composition instructs the performer(s) not to play their instrument(s) during the entire duration of the piece throughout the three movements. The piece has become a very influential piece of Avantgarde art due to its radical questioning of traditional musical reception, the standard distinction between sound and noise, and its focus on the borders between art and life.
1952	Great Smog of '52	 	Up to 12,000 people died in London within a few days in December 1952. Sulphur dioxide levels of 3,82 milligram per cubic meter led to widespread respiratory problems and tripled death rates for the elderly and small children. The event was a key starting point for the international environmental movement.
1953	Double Helix (structure of DNA)	James D. Watson, Francis Crick	The scientists established that the molecules of nucleic acids containing most of the hereditary information necessary for the reproduction of living entities had a double helical structure. It was a major breakthrough which opened the path to genetic research, genetic engineering, genetic profiling, bioinformatics and other current branches of bio- and life-sciences. 
1953	Pornotopia - Playboy Magazine	Hugh Hefner, Paul B. Preciado	Playboy magazine and its architectural expressions, the Playboy Townhouses, furniture and devices for male bachelors constituted Pornotopia, a utopian realisation of (male) desire, anticipating the Net as a spatial metaphor for sexual desires.
1953	Ulm College of Design (New Bauhaus)	Max Bill, Tomás Maldonado	The mission of the Ulm College of Design was to educate the German designers in a modernistic and cosmopolitan aesthetics as an antidote against the irrationalism and cultural backwardness that had dominated Nazi era Germany. The design college was pioneering science-based design methodologies, especially after Bill stepped down in 1958 and was replaced by a triumvirate of directors led by the Argentinian artist Tomás Maldonado.
1954	Information Aesthetics	Max Bense	The German philosopher tried to develop a scientifically founded theory of aesthetics. He combined Birkhoff's Aesthetic Measure, a simple formula for quantifying the beauty of vases, with Information Theory by Claude Shannon. Bense influenced early computer artists such as Frieder Nake and Georg Nees, Germany, Zdenek Sykora, Czechoslovakia, and Hiroshi Kawano, Japan. He also consulted Jasia Reichardt on the Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition.
1955	Bandung Conference		At this conference in Bandung, Indonesia, leaders from Africa and Asia met for the first time without European or American participation. The meeting led to the founding of the movement of non-aligned nations (NAM) who belonged neither to the capitalist West nor to the Soviet-dominated East.
1955	Montgomery Bus Boycott	Rosa Parks	Protest campaign against racial segregation on the public transport system. This event marked a major turning point in the civil rights struggle through the use of non-violent civil disobedience techniques.
1955	Two-step-Flow of Communication	Elihu Katz, Paul Lazarsfeld	Based on research conducted in the early 1940s, Katz and Lazarsfeld concluded that most people form an opinion based on opinion leaders among their primary group. Foundational for social media analysis.
1956	First Transatlantic Telephone Cable		The first transatlantic telecommunications cable (for other uses than telegraphy) was inaugurated on September 25, initially carrying 36 telephone channels.
1957	Sputnik launched		The launch of the first, unmanned communication satellite by the Soviets created the "Sputnik shock" in the US, which was an impulse to invest more heavily in scientific research. One of the agencies founded in response was (D)ARPA ([defence] advanced research projects agency) which initiated and coordinated the research that lead to the Internet.
1958	“The Computer and the Brain”	John von Neumann 	In his unfinished book von Neumann discusses brain-computer analogies based on theories of "cellular automata" and "neural networks." Although von Neumann concluded that such analogies were false, his research is seen as foundational for specific branches of Artificial Intelligence such as machine learning. 
1958	Bionics	Jack E. Steele	The application of biological methods and systems found in nature to the study and design of engineering systems and modern technology.
1958	Théorie de l'information et perception esthétique	Abraham A. Moles	The French sociologist, cybernetician and aestheticist developed an entirely different approach to Information Aesthetics than Bense. His aim was the integration of information theory, behavioral science, and structural aesthetics. It can be read as an early attempt to quantify perception and measure "originality" in an art work.
1959	18 Happenings in 6 parts	Allan Kaprow	In his groundbreaking happening at the Reuben Gallery in New York, Kaprow synthesized his training in action painting with his study of Cage’s scored and performed events. Working from a carefully conceived and tightly scripted score, he created an interactive environment that invited the audience to participate to a degree virtually unprecedented in 20th century art. 
1960	Autodestructive Art Manifesto	Gustav Metzger	This manifesto envisions technological forms of public art that would self-destruct over time due to mechanical or chemical processes, thereby foregrounding the destructive forces embedded in societies depending on a dense net of technological support systems.
1960	Scientific Citation Index	Eugene Garfield	Introduced to measure the impact of a scientific paper, the index helped to establish sciometry - the quantitative analysis of the effects of scientific papers - as a major method across sciences: It has been influential on computer based algorithmic information retrieval methods such as Google's page rank algorithm.
1960	World Population: 3 Billion people		Average annual rate of population change in the period 1960-65: 1,92% The agricultural techniques of the "Green Revolution", antibiotics and generally improved health care and hygienics had a great impact on mortality rates in poor countries. This started a development that led to very high population growth over the next three decades. Governments in developing countries started programs targeting “birth-control” and “family planning”. 
1961	Berlin Wall 	GDR government 	The western-controlled sectors of Berlin became an important loophole for inter-German migration during the first years of the “economic miracle”. In an attempt to stop the brain drain of the young, skilled and well-educated workforce, the GDR government started to construct a wall around West Berlin in the summer of 1961. The Berlin Wall became an important icon for western “freedom” and communist repression.
1961	Blue Sky above the Ruhr Valley	Willy Brandt	Brandt was the first major politician in post-war Germany who made environmental prognosis a major topic of his electorial campaign by demanding that "the sky above the Ruhr valley needs to become blue again". Signals an early shift away from post-war reconstruction towards more complex post-industrial orientation of politics.
1961	Les damnés de la terre (The Wretched of the Earth)	Frantz Fanon	In this book, Fanon, a distinguished psychiatrist from Martinique, investigated the social and psychological effects of colonialism from the point of view of the colonized. Major influence on the civil rights and de-colonial movements as well as theories of post-colonialism.
1961	The (anti-baby) Pill		The anti-baby pill, an oral contraceptive, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. By separating the issues of sex from getting pregnant, it induced a huge paradigm shift in moral values and sexual practices.
1962	First modem to transfer digital data over telephone lines		The Bell Dataphone 103, released in 1962, was the first modem to transfer digital data over telephone lines, with a top speed of 300 bits or 30 characters a second.
1962	Telstar		Telstar 1 was an experimental communications satellite in a non-stationary orbit. It provided the first transatlantic television feed as well as fax and telephone communications.

Their collaboration produced many "firsts" in the use of new technology for the theater: closed-circuit television and projection was used on stage; a fibre-optics camera picked up objects in a performer's pocket; an infrared TV camera captured action in total darkness; a Doppler sonar device translated movement into sound; portable wireless FM transmitters and amplifiers transmitted speech and body sounds to loudspeakers.
1967	Beat the Market: A Scientific Stock Market System	Edward O. Thorp, Shen S. Kassouf 	As a consequence of his success in pioneering probability theory in casino gambling, Edward O. Thorp took his findings to “the biggest casino in the world”: Wall Street. In the book, he reported on his experience as a financial engineer ("quant") who uses quantitative analysis techniques and computers to forecast stock market moves. He is therefore acknowledged as the “godfather of the quants”. 
1967	Picture of planet Earth taken from space	NASA	This picture was immediately taken up by a counter-culture to show the earth as an integrated, fragile system where borders play no role. It was featured on the cover of the first issue of the Whole Earth Catalog. Important for the emerging environmental movement.
1967	Small World Experiment	Stanley Milgram	A social psychologist, he conducted a (real-life) social network experiment in order to find average path lengths between two random individuals.

The digitally connected world has become smaller.
1967	Society of the Spectacle	Guy Debord	The single most influential work by Debord, a member of the Situationist International. This group of European artists analyzed and deconstructed the role of the cultural industry in manipulating political consciousness in the consumer society through the production of spectacles.

1968	“The Mother of All Demos”	Douglas Engelbart	First demonstration of almost all the fundamental elements of modern personal computing: windows, hypertext, graphics, efficient navigation and command input, video conferencing, the computer mouse, word processing, dynamic file linking, revision control, and a collaborative real-time editor (collaborative work). This spawned similar projects at Xerox PARC in the early 1970s leading to the standard interface of personal computers.
1968	Cybernetic Serendipity	Jasia Reichardt (curator)	A group exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London. One part of the exhibition was concerned with algorithms and devices for generating music. Some exhibits were pamphlets describing the algorithms, whilst others presented musical notation produced by computers. Devices made musical effects and played tapes of sounds made by computers. Another part described computer projects such as Gustav Metzger's self-destructive Five screens with computer, a design for a new hospital, a computer programmed structure, and dance choreography.
1968	May '68		Students and workers in Paris launched a new type of revolution.

1969	First Human on the Moon  	NASA Apollo program	It was estimated that one out of five humans followed the live broadcast of the Apollo 11 landing on the moon in 1969. The carefully staged TV pictures became a widely used propaganda tool stating the dominance of capitalism over the communist USSR who had previously been leading in the "space race". Earth seen from space (blue planet) became an important symbol for environmentalism. 
1969	First quantitative hedge fund 	Convertible Hedge Associates (Edward O. Thorp and Jay Regan)	Hedge funds are largely unregulated entities and therefore apply so-called market-neutral strategies: Quantitative (mathematical) models and methods exploit market inefficiencies by making highly-concentrated bets while limiting market exposure through a combination of (statistical) arbitrage and long/short positions.
1969	Genital Panic	Valie Export	In this photographic performance the artist poses with trousers which have been cut to expose the pubic area, while at the same time holding a machine gun.

1969	Stonewall riots		A series of violent demonstrations following a police raid, on June 28, on the most popular gay bar in New York, the Stonewall Inn. These riots expressed the will to fight back against repression rather than to hide and ingnited the modern gay and lesbian movement.
1969	UNIX (computer operating system)	Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie et al.	Unix is an operating system whose basic concept is still in place today, as a multi-tasking, multi-user system where many small programs are strung together through a command-line interface called a shell. Unix and its successors, the various flavours of its free alternative Linux, are the operating systems of choice for software developers and for professional applications such as web servers.
1969	When Attitudes become Form	Harald Szeemann	The exhibition marked the conceptual turn in art: The transition from late modern practices to dematerialized post-modern practices.

1972	Lenin in Budapest	Bálint Szombáthy	By carrying a poster of Lenin – the leader of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 – through Budapest, the artist revealed the socialist revolution as at the same time a lost dream and a society on which the bureaucratic order of the party was imposed; marks the break of artists with the socialist utopia by displaying its icons in the trivial everyday life of "actually existing socialism." 
1972	The Limits to Growth	Club of Rome	Based on computer simulation, this study tried to forecast the effects of exponential growth on a world of limited resources. It triggered a debate about natural limits to unrestrained economic development and its impact on the environment. The report represents the growing ecological consciousness in Western industrial countries. 
1972	Watergate		The arrest of five burglars in the headquarter of the Democratic Party in the Watergate building complex led to revelations about widespread abuse of power by president Richard Nixon, including secret wiretapping at the White House.

Even though the model's hypothesis was falsified during the 1987 market crash, Scholes and Merton received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1997 (Black had died before). BSM had to be calculated on a computer, which initially impeded its use on trading floors. When Joseph Ritchie programmed the formula into a hand-held calculator (1975), it became the paradigmatic tool every trader still uses. 
1973	Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)		The CBOE is the first marketplace for trading listed options.
